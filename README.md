# Batter

Batter is the better version of [BAT](https://projects.blender.org/blender/blender-asset-tracer/). Or, at least, that's what it's supposed to become, within the context of submitting files to a Flamenco render farm. Eventually the code here will be merged into BAT and given a new major version number.

**Warning: This doesn't work yet. It's 100% work in progress prototype stuff.**
